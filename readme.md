# Cryptography Project

This project implements several classical ciphers in Python. The ciphers included are:

- Caesar Cipher
- Hill Cipher
- Playfair Cipher
- Rail Fence Cipher
- Vigenère Cipher

## Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Hill Cipher

The Hill Cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher that encrypts blocks of plaintext into ciphertext using matrix multiplication.

## Playfair Cipher

The Playfair Cipher is a digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters in the plaintext into pairs of letters in the ciphertext.

## Rail Fence Cipher

The Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher that rearranges the letters of the plaintext by writing them in a zigzag pattern.

## Vigenère Cipher

The Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that encrypts the plaintext by shifting each letter according to a keyword.

## Usage

To use the ciphers, simply import the corresponding module and run the main.cpp file using your favourite c++ compiler
